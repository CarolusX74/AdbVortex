# ðŸŒ€ AdbVortex

**AdbVortex** lets you share your computerâ€™s internet connection with any Android device connected via **ADB**, directly from **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Android Studio**.

[![JetBrains Plugin](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/v/28658-adbvortex.svg)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28658-adbvortex)

A simple and elegant proxy controller that creates an HTTP bridge between your desktop and the device â€” perfect for testing backend APIs or internal environments.

---

## Quick info
- **Default proxy:** `127.0.0.1:8080`
- **Supported devices:** Single Android device (stable by default). Multi-device support is experimental.
- **Platform:** IntelliJ Platform plugin (works in IntelliJ IDEA & Android Studio).
- **Icon:** `src/main/resources/icons/adbvortex_32.png` (recommended 32Ã—32 px).

## How it works

1. The plugin starts a lightweight **HTTP proxy** on your computer (default port `8080`).
2. It runs ADB commands to forward traffic:
   ```bash
   adb reverse tcp:<PORT> tcp:<PORT>
   adb shell settings put global http_proxy 127.0.0.1:<PORT>
   ```
3. The device routes its HTTP traffic through the host machine (your computer), allowing the device to reach services running on `localhost` of your computer.

> Note: For HTTPS you need a proxy that supports `CONNECT` and (optionally) user-installed certificates â€” AdbVortex focuses on HTTP for development/testing.

## Installation
You can install it directly from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28658-adbvortex).

Or manually:
1. Download the `.zip` file from the Marketplace.
2. In Android Studio, go to `Settings â†’ Plugins â†’ Install Plugin from Disk`.
3. Select the downloaded file and restart the IDE.

## Quick start (development)

1. Open this project in **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Android Studio**.
2. Run the Gradle task **Run Plugin** (Gradle: `runIde`) to launch a sandbox IDE instance.
3. In the sandbox IDE open the **AdbVortex** Tool Window:
    - Pick a port (default: `8080`).
    - Click **Start** (device must be visible via `adb devices`).
    - On the device open an HTTP URL or test your app â€” traffic will be proxied through your machine.
4. Click **Stop** to clear proxy settings on the device and stop the local proxy.

## UI / UX notes

- The tool window shows logs and device connection status.
- If you want to show connected devices in the top panel, the plugin's UI includes a short list â€” edit `AdbVortexToolWindowFactory` to update the view.
- If logs reach the top and overlap UI controls, set the log panel to auto-scroll or add padding/margins above the button bar in the UI layout.

## Troubleshooting

- Device not shown in the IDE but `adb devices` lists it:
    - Ensure `adb` in PATH used by IntelliJ matches the one you run on the terminal.
    - Consider restarting ADB: `adb kill-server && adb start-server`.
- `offline` device in `adb devices`:
    - Reconnect the USB cable or trust debugging prompt on the device.
- Timeouts from proxy:
    - Check firewall/antivirus blocking.
    - Make sure the device uses the host proxy (verify `settings get global http_proxy` on device).
    - For apps using certificate pinning or HTTPS, HTTP proxying may not work â€” use a proper mitm proxy.
